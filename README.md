R Presentations are a feature of the RStudio IDE that enable easy authoring of HTML5 presentations using a combination of Markdown and R. R Presentations include the following features:

Very straightforward authoring syntax (Markdown)
Easy incorporation of R code and it's output (including plots)
Support for LaTeX equations using MathJax
Flexible two column layouts
Many options for slide transitions and slide navigation
Ability to customize the appearance of slides using CSS
Extensive support for authoring and previewing presentations within the RStudio IDE
Can be played back either inside the RStudio IDE or as standalone HTML5 presentations in a web browser.
Can be easily published as either a standalone HTML file or to RPubs
